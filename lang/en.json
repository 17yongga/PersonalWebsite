Meanwhile, my inbox is flooded with pitches for \"revolutionary AI workforce solutions.\"",

Three weeks of process analysis revealed their real issue: customer service reps were spending 60% of their time manually looking up policy information in legacy systems.",
        "subsection1_p2": "The solution wasn't AI—it was better data integration. We built a simple dashboard that aggregated customer data from three systems into one view. Customer response time improved by 40%, and the project cost 80% less than the proposed chatbot.",

        "subsection2_p2": "At a healthcare client, we built an AI tool that could flag potential diagnosis errors in medical records. The technology worked brilliantly in testing—95% accuracy, lightning-fast processing. But six months post-launch, adoption was stuck at 12%. Why? The doctors felt the system was questioning their expertise rather than supporting it.",
        "subsection2_p3": "We redesigned the interface to position AI suggestions as \"additional considerations\" rather than \"error alerts.\" Adoption jumped to 78% within two months. Same technology, different framing.",
        "subsection3_title": "3. Underestimating Data Quality and Governance",
        "subsection3_p1": "Here's a harsh truth: <strong>AI amplifies the quality of your data—both good and bad.</strong> Garbage in, garbage out, but faster and at scale.",
        "subsection3_p2": "I worked with a retail client who wanted to implement demand forecasting AI. Their historical sales data was a mess—different product SKUs, inconsistent naming conventions, missing seasonal data. They wanted to launch in 12 weeks.

        "section3_title": "A Real Success Story",
        "section3_p1": "Let me share a project that got it right. A financial services client approached me with a specific problem: their loan underwriters were spending 3-4 hours per application manually reviewing financial documents and cross-referencing data points.",
        "section3_p2": "We scored high on all PRIME dimensions: clear processes (documented underwriting guidelines), committed resources (dedicated budget and team), solid integration plan (API access to core systems), specific metrics (reduce review time to under 1 hour while maintaining approval accuracy), and realistic expectations (AI assists, humans decide).",
        "section3_p3": "The result? We built an AI system that pre-populates application reviews with key data points and flags potential issues.

        "intro_p1": "I'm currently an Implementation Consultant at Capco, working with major banks and financial institutions on complex transformation projects. It's challenging work that I genuinely enjoy. But over the past year, I've been exploring something on the side: <strong>YongAI</strong>, an AI consulting initiative that applies everything I've learned in enterprise consulting to helping organizations actually adopt AI.",
        "intro_p2": "I haven't quit my day job. I'm not writing this from a garage somewhere, burning through savings. This is about what happens when a consultant starts thinking like a builder — and the surprising lessons that come from straddling both worlds.",
        "section1_title": "The Mindset Shift: From Optimization to Creation",
        "section1_p1": "In my consulting work, I'm a problem-solver. Clients come with established businesses, existing processes, and clear (if complex) challenges. My job is to diagnose issues, design solutions, and optimize what already exists. I've gotten good at this — give me an underperforming process and I can map inefficiencies, propose improvements, and deliver measurable results.",
        "section1_p2": "Building something from scratch is a completely different muscle. With YongAI, there are no existing processes to optimize because <em>nothing exists yet</em>. Every framework, every offering, every potential client relationship has to be created from zero. This shift from \"fixing what's broken\" to \"building what doesn't exist\" requires a different kind of thinking.",
        "section1_quote": "<em>In consulting, the hardest question is usually \"How do we fix this?\" When you're building something new, it's \"What should I build?\" — and that question has infinite possible answers.</em>",
        "section2_title": "Why Consultants Are Well-Positioned for This",
        "section2_intro": "The more I explore the AI space, the more I realize that consulting provides excellent preparation — but not for the reasons you might expect.",
        "subsection1_title": "We're Used to Ambiguous Problems",
        "subsection1_p1": "Consultants thrive in unclear situations. Clients rarely come to us saying \"Here's exactly what's wrong and exactly how to fix it.\" They say things like \"Our sales are down, our employees seem unhappy, and we're losing market share.\" We're trained to work backwards from vague problems to specific, actionable solutions.",
        "subsection1_p2": "This skill translates directly to the AI space, where organizations know they \"need AI\" but have no idea where to start. When someone says \"We think we need AI but we're not sure what kind,\" I don't panic — I grab my trusty framework and start asking clarifying questions. That's just Tuesday for a consultant.",
        "subsection2_title": "We Know How to Build Trust Quickly",
        "subsection2_p1": "Consultants are professional outsiders. We walk into organizations where we know nobody, understand little about the industry specifics, and somehow need to gain enough trust that executives will listen to our recommendations on massive changes.",
        "subsection2_p2": "This ability to build credibility quickly is incredibly relevant when talking to organizations about AI. There's a lot of hype and a lot of skepticism. Being able to position yourself as someone who understands both the technology and the business reality — that's a consulting superpower.",
        "subsection3_title": "We're Comfortable Being Wrong (Then Adapting)",
        "subsection3_p1": "Good consultants know that initial hypotheses are usually wrong. You start with educated guesses, test them against reality, and pivot when the data says you're off track. This \"strong opinions, weakly held\" mindset is essential when exploring new territory.",
        "subsection3_p2": "My original thinking for YongAI focused heavily on building custom AI solutions. But the more conversations I had, the more I realized most organizations don't need custom models — they need help integrating existing AI tools into their workflows and building the organizational capability to use them. That realization reshaped my entire approach.",
        "section3_title": "The Traps I'm Watching Out For",
        "section3_intro": "Not everything from consulting translates well. Here are the tendencies I've noticed in myself that I'm actively trying to counteract:",
        "trap1_title": "Over-Engineering Everything",
        "trap1_p1": "Consultants are trained to deliver polished, comprehensive solutions. We create detailed frameworks, beautiful presentations, and thorough documentation. When you're exploring a new venture, this perfectionism can be paralyzing.",
        "trap1_p2": "I caught myself spending weeks building elaborate positioning documents before I'd even validated the core idea with real people. Those documents were thorough, well-researched, and premature. Conversations with actual prospects taught me more about what the market needs than any amount of desk research.",
        "trap2_title": "Defaulting to \"Analysis Mode\"",
        "trap2_p1": "When faced with uncertainty, consultants gather more data. We run surveys, conduct interviews, and build models until we feel confident. When you're exploring something new, this can become a comfortable hiding place — an excuse to keep researching instead of actually doing.",
        "trap2_p2": "I've had to push myself to move from analysis to action faster than feels natural. Sometimes the answer comes from a 15-minute conversation, not a six-week research project.",
        "trap3_title": "Underestimating the Emotional Difference",
        "trap3_p1": "Consulting projects have defined timelines, clear success metrics, and built-in ending points. When a project goes sideways, there's usually shared accountability. Building your own thing is emotionally different — every win and every setback feels personal in a way that client work doesn't.",
        "trap3_p2": "Learning to treat feedback as market data rather than personal rejection has been an ongoing calibration.",
        "section4_title": "What I'm Taking Away So Far",
        "section4_takeaway1": "<strong>Start conversations before you're ready.</strong> Consultants are used to feeling fully prepared before presenting to clients. When exploring a new direction, \"ready enough\" beats \"perfect.\" I should have started talking to people about this idea months earlier than I did.",
        "section4_takeaway2": "<strong>Your network is your unfair advantage.</strong> Those years of building relationships with executives, understanding their challenges, and proving your competence? That's not just a career asset — it's a launchpad. The trust you've already built opens doors that cold outreach never could.",
        "section4_takeaway3": "<strong>The gap in the market is real.</strong> Through my consulting work, I've seen firsthand how many organizations struggle with AI adoption — not because the technology isn't there, but because they lack the structured approach to evaluate, implement, and scale it. That's a consulting problem, not a tech problem. And consultants are uniquely equipped to solve it.",
        "section5_title": "Where This Goes",
        "section5_p1": "I don't have a dramatic \"I quit my job\" story. What I have is a growing conviction that the intersection of enterprise consulting and AI implementation is where I can create the most value. My experience at Capco — running workshops, mapping processes, managing complex stakeholder environments — is directly applicable to helping organizations navigate AI adoption.",
        "section5_p2": "YongAI is still early. I'm learning, experimenting, and figuring out what the right offering looks like. But the foundation is solid: deep consulting methodology applied to the most transformative technology of our generation.",
        "section5_p3": "For other consultants who see the same opportunity — you don't have to make a dramatic leap. Start exploring. Have conversations. Build something small on the side. The skills you've developed solving complex business problems are exactly what the AI space needs right now.",

        "intro_p1": "What started as a weekend coding project to add some personality to my portfolio has turned into one of the most educational AI experiments I've ever conducted. <strong>\"Ask Gary\"</strong> was supposed to be a simple chatbot that could answer basic questions about my background. Six months and 2,000+ conversations later, it's taught me more about human-AI interaction than any industry report ever could.",
        "intro_p2": "Here's the story of building an AI version of myself, the technical decisions that shaped it, and the fascinating insights from watching people interact with my digital twin.",
        "brief_title": "The Original Brief (To Myself)",
        "brief_p1": "The concept was straightforward: create an AI assistant that could handle the basic questions I get asked repeatedly—my background, experience, project details, and availability. Think of it as an interactive FAQ that could engage in natural conversation.",

        "personality_title": "The Personality Challenge",
        "personality_p1": "The hardest part wasn't the technical implementation—it was teaching an AI to sound like me. How do you distill your communication style, humor, and personality quirks into prompt engineering?",
        "personality_p2": "I started by analyzing my own writing patterns. I read through hundreds of my emails, Slack messages, and LinkedIn posts, looking for consistent patterns:",

        "engagement_title": "Progressive Engagement: The Secret Sauce",
        "engagement_p1": "Here's where Ask Gary gets interesting. Instead of treating every interaction as isolated, it builds context over the course of a conversation. The system tracks:",

        "technical_p2": "What's interesting is how the AI adapts its explanations based on the user's background. When someone asks about machine learning model selection, Ask Gary gauges their expertise level and adjusts accordingly.",
        "uncanny_title": "The Uncanny Valley of Conversation",
        "uncanny_p1": "One unexpected challenge has been managing user expectations about what Ask Gary can and cannot do. Some people forget they're talking to an AI and ask questions that require real-time information or personal opinions I haven't programmed in.",
        "uncanny_p2": "The solution was to make the AI's limitations transparent and even leverage them as conversation starters. When Ask Gary doesn't know something, it says so honestly and suggests how the user could get the real answer (often by contacting me directly).",

        "human_title": "The Human Touch Still Matters",
        "human_p1": "As sophisticated as Ask Gary has become, the most meaningful conversations still happen when people connect with me directly. The AI is excellent at providing information and initial engagement, but it can't replace human connection for complex discussions.",
        "human_p2": "Ask Gary works best as a bridge—introducing people to my work and approach, then seamlessly transitioning to human interaction when appropriate.",
        "psychology_title": "The Psychology of Talking to Yourself",
        "psychology_p1": "Here's something I didn't anticipate: interacting with an AI version of myself has been surprisingly reflective. Reading conversations helps me understand how others perceive my communication style and what aspects of my work resonate most with people.",
        "psychology_p2": "It's also shown me patterns in my own thinking that I wasn't aware of. Ask Gary consistently structures responses in ways that mirror how I approach complex problems—breaking them down, providing context, offering practical next steps. Seeing this pattern externalized has made me more intentional about how I communicate.",
        "future_title": "What's Next for Ask Gary",
        "future_p1": "The experiment continues. I'm exploring ways to make Ask Gary even more useful while maintaining the authentic, personal feel that makes it engaging. The goal isn't to replace human interaction but to enhance it—providing better context for meaningful conversations.",
        "future_p2": "If you haven't tried Ask Gary yet, I encourage you to <a href=\"../ask-gary.html\">give it a conversation</a>. Ask it anything you're curious about regarding AI, consulting, or career transitions. You might be surprised by how natural it feels to talk to an AI version of someone you've never met.",
        "future_p3": "<strong>And if you're building your own AI assistant,</strong> remember that the technology is just the beginning. The real challenge—and the real opportunity—is in capturing the human nuances that make conversations genuinely helpful and engaging."
