Engagement 6: E2E Process Analyst @ Tier‑1 Global Bank – Wealth Management Platform Transformation
Client
In my current project, I have been instrumental in developing and maintaining strong
relationships with the client. Through regular workshop-style meetings, I present the
process flows I created, ensuring that the client has a clear understanding of each step.
I engage actively with the client across multiple channels, including Teams and email, to
promptly address any questions or concerns. This proactive approach has helped
strengthen trust with the client, ensuring that any feedback is quickly incorporated into
the process flows. Additionally, I identified and highlighted gaps in user stories during
these workshops, which led to the creation of new requirements. My actions have
consistently influenced the client’s decision-making process and contributed to positive
project outcomes.
People
As a collaborative team member, I took a leadership role by assisting my colleagues in
reconciling outstanding clarifications in their respective pods, helping to provide the
client with a clear view of unresolved questions. Additionally, I proactively engaged with
other pods, such as the Tax pod, to explain our process flow methodology and assist
them in kick-starting their own flow creation. This effort fostered stronger collaboration
between different teams. My mentoring of junior colleagues, such as Stephen and Brian
has contributed to a more aligned and productive team environment. I’ve actively
supported both the team’s and my own development, applying feedback to continuously
improve our performance.
Delivery
I led the creation of over 10 detailed process flows that outline the future state of wealth
account and customer information management on the new advisor portal. Each flow
included comprehensive annotations linking user stories, regulatory controls, and
capabilities. Throughout this process, I identified and addressed gaps in user stories by
driving the creation of new requirements. Furthermore, when an issue arose with
uploading process flows into the IS tool, I not only troubleshooted the problem and
found a solution, but I also went a step further by creating a tool that enabled the rest of
the team to upload their flows seamlessly. My contributions have improved the project’s
delivery process, increased team efficiency, and ensured that all outputs met the high
standards expected by both the client and Capco.
Lessons Learned
From this engagement, I’ve learned the importance of proactively managing client
relationships, influencing their decisions through detailed analysis, and delivering
solutions that address gaps in project requirements. I’ve also developed leadership
skills by mentoring team members and fostering collaboration across different pods,

while enhancing my problem-solving abilities by not only resolving technical issues but
also creating tools to streamline processes for the team. Moving forward, I will apply
these skills to take on more advisory roles with clients, lead larger teams, and
positioning myself for greater responsibility and growth within Capco.



Summary
Reflecting on my performance so far as an associate, I think I am performing at an above-expected
level, consistently exceeding expectations in delivery quality and client management as a BA on both
the Tier-1 Canadian Commercial Bank - Reconciliation Automation Reconciliation project and the on-going Tier-1 Global Bank - Major Bank Merger Deveron Project

Delivery
On the Tier-1 Canadian Commercial Bank - Reconciliation Automation Reconciliation Project, I have delivered outstanding artefacts that were recognized by
both my manager, the client, as well as the client’s manager (VP level executive). There were three
main deliverables that I took part in:
1. Automated Reconciliation Status Checker:
a. This tool checks the completion status of 300+ daily reconciliation processes across 5
different LOBs. It can do the task in less than 5 minutes with one click of a button in
excel, which used to take one senior manager a whole day to complete.
b. I led the entire solution, from problem discovery through workshops, to
development, then all the way to delivery with detailed documentation
c. The excellent solution quality is recognized by my manager, the client, as well as the
client’s manager at the VP level.
2. Automated Reconciliation Solutions:
a. I built solutions that automated 3 reconciliation processes in Tier-1 Canadian Commercial Bank - Reconciliation Automation’s FinOps team,
turning processes that initially took 3-4 hours daily to tasks that takes less than 10
minutes to complete.
b. I led 2 of the 3 solutions from initiation to completion with significant contribution
to the other one.
c. Clients were delighted and spoke highly about my contribution, as it saved them
from hours of manual labour daily.
3. Business Requirement Documents:
a. I led the process discovery of 10+ reconciliation processes through multiple client
workshops, where I identified over 5k+ hours of annual time savings through
automation. What also came out of the workshops were process diagrams that
helped the FinOps team realize bottle necks easily.
b. The Tier-1 Canadian Commercial Bank - Reconciliation Automation FinOps Automation Team (WE Squad) was very appreciative of my
contribution in defining requirements for these automation solutions.
On the Tier-1 Global Bank - Major Bank Merger Deveron Project so far, I have already delivered impactful artefacts that helped the
team effectively align objectives with various client teams, who are at different readiness levels for
the conversion. My draft cutover runbook was shared with the rest of the team as an example to
follow when reaching out to different client teams.
Client
On the Tier-1 Canadian Commercial Bank - Reconciliation Automation Reconciliation project, I led 8+ stakeholders independently, guiding them through series
of workshops to understand their reconciliation process, validate pain points, then translating them
to requirements for a proposed automated solution.
I also managed 4 other stakeholders throughout the creation of the 4 automated solutions discussed
above. I created effective feedback loops through all communication channels that resulted in timely

completion of the deliverables. I received positive feedback and appreciation from all stakeholders
for my contributions.
On the Tier-1 Global Bank - Major Bank Merger Deveron Project so far, I have established solid relationship already with 2 of the main
workstream leads, having weekly meetings and connects scheduled to keep things moving. I was
also able to effectively bring the stakeholders onto the same page quickly through well planned out
workshops, clear answers to concerns/questions, and detailed artefact drafts.
People
On the Tier-1 Canadian Commercial Bank - Reconciliation Automation project, I played key roles in other member’s deliverables. 2 examples:
1. I led the development of an automated solution proposed by my team member to the client,
collaborating closely throughout development and testing phases, ensuring that feedbacks
from the client is reflected in the final deliverable.
2. I assisted a senior member on the team to perform intercompany reconciliation analysis that
was then presented to senior executives on the client side.
On the Tier-1 Global Bank - Major Bank Merger project, while managing my own workstreams and stakeholders, I am also collaborating
with my team member on managing his workstreams, exchanging learnings and easing the workload
on his shoulders.
On both projects, my deliverables were always being referenced by other team members and my
manager as the example to follow.
Community
I took part in the Knowledge Management Tool project, where as a BA, I created user stories for the
product and refined them through conversations with the design and development team.
I co-organized a boulders and beers community event, where I took 20+ Capco employees to my
favourite bouldering gym in Toronto. Everyone had a blast.
Learnings
I learned that being confident in front of clients and know your objective heading into
meetings/engagements are game changers. I’ve always thought that the client would always be
more knowledgeable than me and that they know exactly how best they can help us. The clients may
be SMEs for their business and operations, but they may not know how best to assist us with our
goals/objectives. I need to provide guidance in the most effective way possible for them to
understand our scope and our intention. I need to have the courage to steer conversions back on
track even when the stakeholder is more senior than me. I realized that workshops are not just one-
sided information gathering, it should be an active conversation where I am fully engaged in keeping
the client focused on providing the exact information that I am looking for.
